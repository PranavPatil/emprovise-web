    <p>The  .NET Compact Framework version 3.5 expands support for distributed  mobile applications by including the Windows Communication Foundation  (WCF) technology. It also adds new language features such as LINQ, new  APIs based on community feedback, and improves debugging with updated  diagnostic tools and features.</p>
    <p>For details about these new features and enhancements, see <a id="ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl156_ctl00_ctl00" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397835.aspx" onclick="javascript:Track('ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl156_ctl00_contenthere|ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl156_ctl00_ctl00',this);">What's New in the .NET Compact Framework Version 3.5</a>.</p>

    <p>The .NET Framework 3.5 includes  enhancements in targeted areas of ASP.NET and Visual Web Developer. The  most significant advance is improved support for the development of  AJAX-enabled Web sites. ASP.NET supports server-centric AJAX  development with a set of new server controls and APIs. You can enable  an existing ASP.NET 2.0 page for AJAX by adding a <a id="ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl157_ctl00_ctl00" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.scriptmanager.aspx" onclick="javascript:Track('ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl157_ctl00_contenthere|ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl157_ctl00_ctl00',this);">ScriptManager</a> control and an <a id="ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl157_ctl00_ctl01" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.updatepanel.aspx" onclick="javascript:Track('ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl157_ctl00_contenthere|ctl00_MTCS_main_ctl157_ctl00_ctl01',this);">UpdatePanel</a> control so that the page can update without requiring a full page refresh.</p>
    <p>ASP.NET  also supports client-centric AJAX development with a new client library  called the Microsoft AJAX Library. The Microsoft AJAX Library supports  client-centric, object-oriented development, which is  browser-independent. By using the library classes in your ECMAScript  (JavaScript) you can enable rich UI behaviors without roundtrips to the  server. You can mix the degree of server-centric and client-centric  development to meet the needs of your application. Furthermore, Visual  Web Developer includes improved IntelliSense support for JavaScript and  support for the Microsoft AJAX Library.</p>
    <p>ASP.NET and Visual Web  Developer now support the creation of both ASMX and WCF-based Web  services and the seamless use of either implementation from Web pages  using Microsoft AJAX Library. Furthermore, server-side application  services including forms authentication, roles management, and profiles  are now exposed as Web services that can be consumed in WCF-compatible  applications, including client script and Window Forms clients. ASP.NET  enables all Web-based applications to share these common application  services.</p>
